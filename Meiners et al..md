Title: **IL-33 facilitates rapid expulsion of the parasitic nematode *Strongyloides ratti* from the intestine via ILC2- and IL-9-driven mast cell activation**

## Pathway

1. Parasite-migration triggered release of IL-33
2. IL-33 (with other alarmin e.g. IL-25) mediated ILC2 expansion
3. ILC2 mediated IL-9 production increases. IL-9 also activates more ILC2 and thus complete self-enhancing. 
4. IL-9 mediated mast cell activation
5. Mast cell mediated *S. ratti* expulsion. 

## Introduction

### Helminth Infection Immune Response

- Controlled and eradicated by canonical type 2 immune response

### Type 2 Immune Response

- Secretion of IL-4 but no IFN-$\gamma$
- Inflammation by eosinophilic and basophilic tissue infiltration
- Extensive mast cell degranulation

### IL-33

- Tissue-derived nuclear cytokin. (alarmin)
- Triggered by ...
	- Exposure to migrating parasitic nematodes
		- mechanical damage of skin (tape stripping-induced)
		- protease-containing allergen damage to the lung
	- Intranasal application of chitin (parasites cuticula)
- Triggered in lung and intestine
- Central function in host defence.
	- Evidenced by ...
	- Lacking IL-33 or IL-33 receptor ST2 => intestinal parasite / larval burdens
	- Chronic intestinal parasite (*Heligmosomoides polygyrus*) antagonizes IL-33 with IL-33 inhibitors

### IL-9

- Secreted by Th2 cell and ILC2 cell (innate)
- Stimulator factor for mast cells.

## Methods

### Utility

- *H. polygyrus*-derived IL-33-suppressive alarmin release inhibitor (HpARI)
- IL-33-stabilizing truncation variant of HpARI (CCP1/2)
- Recombinant (rec.) IL-33 

#### HpARI
- MOW: Tether IL-33 to the nuclear DNA. Blocking ST2.
- Consists of 3 domains
	- Domain 1 binds to genomic DNA
	- Domain 3 exhibits high affinity to IL-33 and thus blocking its ligation with ST2.

#### CCP1/2
- @chauche2020
- Non-natural truncation of HpARI: first 2 domains
- Lower affinity to IL-33 than original form
- MOW: Stabilize IL-33, preventing its degradation, mentaining IL-33 in its active form.

- BALB/c mice has tendency towards type 2 immune respons
	- inherently susceptible to bacterial infections
	- inherently resistant to infection by helminths

## Result

### IL-33 reduces intestine parasite abundance

- CCP 1/2 can be considered as "baseline" effect of endogenous IL-33.
	- CCP 1/2 binds (10-fold lower affinity) and stabilizes IL-33, without effecting its affinity to ST2, such "stabilization" effect probably prevent the binding of from parasite secreted full-length HpARI. Thus releasing full potential of endogenous IL-33.
	- PBS (negative control) has, idealy, same amount of endeogenous IL-33 as CCP 1/2 group, but since they are not stabilized, some are bound to HpARI and thus deactivated. 
	- Same MOW also goes to natural degradation of IL-33 (CCP 1/2 maintains the active form of IL-33)
	- Leading to siginificance between PBS and CCP 1/2.
- Neutrophils and eosinophis specialize in killing migrating nematodes in tissue.

Fig 2B/2C. 
- IL-33 is not targeting moving *S. ratti* during the tissue migrating stage (day 1-3 p.i), but rather "anbushing" those parasite reaching the intestines and try to embed themselves.
- "Newly arriving larvae encountering a hostile environment in the intestine and failing to embed into the mucosa."

### **Independent working pathway from other innate compartments and adaptive system**

By knocking out cetain compartments of immune system. See Fig 3-4.

### IL-33 triggers mast cell activation via ILC2 and IL-9

- Confirmation of contribution of IL-9 in the pathway (Fig. 4D)
- See Fig 5. Also by knocking out other compartments. 

## Conclusion

- IL-33 induces rapid activation of mucosal mast cells.
	- Accelerated independent mast cell activation.
	- Strictly depends on ILC present and IL-9 receptor.
- Preventing embedment of arriving parasites in the intestines.
- Non-redundant IL-33-triggered ILC2-, IL-9-, and mast cell-dependent innate pathway.

## Outlooks & Further Notions

- In fact, IL-4 knockout mice are perfectly resistant to _Nippostrongylus_ infection, indicating that IL-4 is not required for protection against this helminth in mice @lawrence1996
