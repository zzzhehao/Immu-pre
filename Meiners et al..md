- Selectively mast cell-deficient mice are unable to terminate infections for more than 20 weeks. ^acdc51
- *S. ratti* actively delays this rapid IL-9-dependent mas cell-mediated expulsion. ^ca9997
	- Expansion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg
	- Induction of negative regulatory receptors, e.g. B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) on T effector cells. (Ligand of BTLA: HVEM)

### IL-33

- Tissue-derived nuclear cytokin. (alarmin)
- Triggered by ...
	- Exposure to migrating parasitic nematodes
	- Intranasal application of chitin (parasites cuticula)
- Triggered in lung and intestine
- Central function in host defence.
	- Evidenced by ...
	- Lacking IL-33 or IL-33 receptor ST2 => intestinal parasite / larval burdens
	- Chronic intestinal parasite (*Heligmosomoides polygyrus*) antagonizes IL-33 with IL-33 inhibitors

## Methods

### Utility

- *H. polygyrus*-derived IL-33-suppressive alarmin release inhibitor (HpARI)
- IL-33-stabilizing truncation variant of HpARI (CCP1/2)
- Recombinant (rec.) IL-33 

#### HpARI
- MOW: Tether IL-33 to the nuclear DNA. Blocking ST2.

#### CCP1/2
- @chauche2020
- Non-natural truncation of HpARI: first 2 domains
- Lower affinity to IL-33 than original form
- MOW: Bind to and stabilize IL-33, preventing its degradation, mentaining IL-33 in its active form.

## Result

### IL-33 reduces parasite burden

## Conclusion

- IL-33 induces rapid activation of mucosal mast cells.
	- Accelerated independent mast cell activation.
	- Strictly depends on ILC present and IL-9 receptor.
- Preventing embedment of arriving parasites in the intestines.
- Non-redundant IL-33-triggered ILC2-, IL-9-, and mast cell-dependent innate pathway.
